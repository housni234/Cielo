        <div class="row"></div>
        <div class="text-center col approach-intro">Startup Cielo™ has a unique approach to startup development, backed up by proprietary
            frameworks and
            innovative research
            in the fields of entrepreneurship, organization structure, systematic venture development, and
            entrepreneurship education.<br>
            Our environment combines in-depth individual coaching, rigorous group mentoring, a diversified curriculum
            from a variety of
            business school subjects, and complete customization toward a participant's startup idea.<br>
            Startup Cielo™ approach is built on three main pillars of effectiveness: systematization, 
            individualization, and experimentation.
            All of our programs are offered virtually and last one calendar year from start to finish. Besides, they can
            be layered with an academic
            certificate degree from an accredited academic institution (at an additional cost paid directly to the
            business school).

                    At the foundation of our startup incubator lies the logical math-inspired scientific framework,
                    titled Organizational Coordinate System. This system is designed to provide business leaders with
                    a set of questions and tools to design their organization and identify potential areas of resource
                    and effort concentration. The organizational Coordinate System also allows the entrepreneurs a
                    structured guided process for startup venture development. Every segment takes 2-3 months to
                    complete
                    and provide a segment outcome, which allows the startup program participant to move forward.

                <div class="our-approach-text">In our startup incubator, we pay incredible attention to the concept of
                    the individuality of a
                    human. Our program is developed specifically for the underdogs, the individuals with limited
                    resources, capacity, or other physical, mental, or emotional constraints, deemed unfit for success
                    in the field of choice.<br>
                    Our startup incubator program is designated to explore, challenge, and redefine an individual as
                    a leader in their environment (incl. leadership values, style, strengths and weaknesses, areas for
                    further development, and most effective communication approach), and redesigning the environment for
                    the humanistic, sustainable, value-oriented outcome.<br>
                    Our market includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>aspiring entrepreneurs without an academic degree or extensive experience</li>
